Based on a C API, I created a Python module that contains:

- A function that returns the n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence.
- Functions that calculate the value of the density function for the most common probability distributions:
  - Normal
  - Uniform
  - t-Student
  - Exponential
  - Chi-squared
  - Cauchy
- Functions that return values of the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for the most common probability distributions:
  - Normal
  - Uniform
  - t-Student
  - Exponential
  - Chi-squared
  - Cauchy
- Functions that return percentiles for the most common probability distributions:
  - Normal
  - Uniform
  - t-Student
  - Exponential
  - Chi-squared
  - Cauchy

Possible minor changes and enhancements can be expected.
