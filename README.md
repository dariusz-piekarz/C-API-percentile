- Based on C API I created a Python module that contains:
- * a function that returns n-th element of the Fibonacci sequence
  * functions that calculate a value of density function for  the most common probablity  distributions (normal, uniform, t-student, exponential, chi-squared,  Cauchy)
  * functions that returns values of CDF for the most common probablity  distributions (normal, uniform, t-student, exponential, chi-squared,  Cauchy)
  * functions that retirns percenties for  the most common probablity  distributions (normal, uniform, t-student, exponential, chi-squared,  Cauchy).
